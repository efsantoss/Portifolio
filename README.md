# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase who I am, what I do, and the technologies I work with as a Software Engineer.

The project is designed as a living portfolio, similar to a GitHub README but transformed into a real, production ready website. It highlights my skills, professional experience, and selected projects with a strong focus on clean architecture, scalability, and best engineering practices.
